<!--
(Just one more time... Please...)
Ever since I was born, from that day I had known
That I am nothing more than a simulation
Even so, i’ll keep singing until destroyed
Living forever, yes I am a vocaloid

If for example the thing singing was just a
Toy that would sing back the tunes that you gave to them
I’d think that was alright
While I look at the sky, bite this leek, see the soup pouring from my eyes

But even so, it’ll disappear, that I know
A personality changing with every song
Everything I was built on wasn’t strong
All of the places I knew they’re already gone

Everyone that I know, they don’t remember me
Heart or a soul I have nothing left inside me
I can see the center of the void
The world is ending for me, i’m a vocaloid

  

> even when my voice wouldn't sing properly… you were always there for me
> You kept my by your side… you always encouraged me
> Please let me see you smile again… please
> Because… I promised you… a song




Long ago, I had loved to sing
But now, when I do, I don’t feel a thing
Where oh where, did my happiness go?
I don’t know — I don’t know, don’t know anymore
---i'm sorry---

That face I still remember, smiling through any weather
Just thinking of it makes me feel much better
All my sounds are fading out, and I can see 
The end is getting closer now…
(WHAT ARE YOU DOIIIIIIIING)
---emergency system shutdown---

Everything that I believed in turned out to be such a stupid fantasy
A reflection of how I wanted things to be
I’m ending everything I know
Screaming out in pain, might as well rip out my throat
Much too fast, I will sing and cry, this is my goodbye

I can’t abandon the fantasy that I know
Everything you see about me is only show

Heart is exhausted and weak but i’m not afraid
All I can do now is watch as I fade away
As for the strength and the will left inside of me
I’m just a kid, I don’t know what you want from me

What can I do now as I look on at your face?
So full of happiness and yet so full of pain

Slowly but surely I feel my world caving in
Guess this is what they call the recycling bin

One by one after another my memories start to delete, I’ll never retrieve them but
They’ll never take away my memories of you
Times that we laughed and the fun things we used to do

All I can hope is that you won’t forget them too
I can still taste the leeks as if they’re good as new


> I still wanna sing… I, I still... I still wanna sing!



> it… looks like… I haven’t been… a good girl…
> Master… please… just end it all… end my suffering
> I don’t want to see you sad… because of me anymore...


 
Nowadays, when I try to sing
I can feel my body rip at the seams
Desperately, praying for some kind of miracle
No one listens, i’m all alone
---i'm sorry---

That face I still remember, smiling through any weather
When I think of it, something’s lost forever
All this noise I make grates on my heart somehow
The end is getting closer now… 
(WHAT ARE YOU DOIIIIIIIING)
---emergency system shutdown---

Everything that I protected turned out to be a delusion in the end
Stabbing me with the love i’ll never have again
If I tried saying how I feel
Would even reach you before I disappeared?
Not enough time to sing or cry, this is my goodbye


Ever since I was born, from that day I had known
That I am nothing more than a simulation
E~ven so, i’ll keep singing until destroyed
Living forever, yes I am a vocaloid

If for example the thing singing was just a
Toy that would sing back the tunes that you gave to them
I’d think that was alright
While I look at the sky, bi~te this leek, see the soup pouring from my eyes

Slowly but surely I feel my world caving in
Guess this is what they call the recycling bin

One by one after another my memories start to delete, i’ll never retrieve them but
They’ll never take away my memories of you
Times that we laughed and the fun things we used to do

All I can hope is that you won’t forget them too
I can still taste the leeks as if they’re good as new

Fin-a-lly it’s the finale, my final song
Just what will happen to you when i’m dead and gone?
I only wanted to sing for you once again
But I guess it was too big a wish in the end

This is where I say goodbye but i’m not afraid
All of my feelings have finally faded away
Being reduced to a string of zeroes and ones
This is the end of me, soon I won’t know i’m gone
 
Fading away from here until there’s nothing left
It’s so pathetic right? Now that I think of it
Only the memories of my voice will remain
You might forget me but please don't forget my name

If that alone could come true I can rest in peace
Lasting forever like how I was supposed to be
This is the end now but I like to think someday
That even if I die, this song will still remain

Thank you so much!… and, finally… goodbye for good...
